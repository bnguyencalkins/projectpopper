			<h1>About TC Popper</h1>
			<h2>What is this site?</h2>
			<p>
				TC Popper is a site for Technical Communication undergraduates. Visitors can view other technical communication projects to brainstorm, or they can submit their own projects to inspire others.  
			</p>
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>If you want to know <i>why</i> this site was made...</p>
			<p>Originally created for a senior capstone project, TC Popper was designed to test internet technology and its application. It took approximately a month to design. The creator graduated in Technical Writing and Communication and was greatly motivated by the need for a department archive for senior capstone projects. The project prioritized self-maintenance and accessibility.</p>
			
			<h2>How can I submit my project?</h2>
			<p>
				It's as simple as one-two-three.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click the submission link <a href="/submission.html"> here.</a></li>
				<li>Fill out the form.</li>
				<li>View your project in the archives, <a href="/submission.html">here</a>.</li>

			</ol>

			<h2>How does this site work?</h2>
			<p>
				This static site brings user-submitted content to life! It depends on a CSV file, a parser, and JavaScript.
			</p>
			<h3>Google Forms and Sheets</h3>
			<p>
				 When someone fills out the linked Google Form, the answers get imported to a separate Sheet file. 
			</p>
			<h3>Papa Parse, Javascript, and objects</h3>
			<p>
				The direct download link is imported into the linked JavaScript and, with the help of <a href="https://www.papaparse.com/">Papa Parse</a>, each entry is turned into an object. In order for Papa Parse to properly create the array of objects, the download link supplies a CSV format. 
			</p>
			<h3>CSS and design</h3>
			<p>
				The JS creates a Popper for each object. With the help of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), each element of the Popper can be customized with border colors, box shadows, and organization.
			</p>

			<h2>Potential improvements, transfers, and more.</h2>
			<p>
				I wanted to add a link feature so users could supply an external link to the project, however I just couldn't get it to funcion properly. </p>
			<p>
				The repository to this site is <a href="https://github.com/bnguyencalkins/projectpopper">linked here</a>. 
				Download the files if you'd like to move it. If you're in a position to transfer this program to another host, you may need to request permission to edit and access both the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iYLFhgmzM2JY5KFhbN9UTXoDeGm5oTQBSd5c20O2YYk/edit?usp=sharing">Google Form</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tnnik4Ej7NycIFd-F6RrMjHqBUp3fzXoBRGx2PqEc9E/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet file</a>. Currently, only users with emails from the University of Minnesota can submit their responses.
			</p>
			<p>
				The site, visually, is bland. I think a good visual redo could spice up the presentation of the site. Also, I didn't want to put in the time to make a cool site icon. In fact, the icon link is broken on this About page!
